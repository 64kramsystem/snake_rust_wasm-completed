# snake_rust_wasm-completed

My progress (now completed) on the Udemy "Snake Game With Rust, JavaScript, and WebAssembly" course.

I originally applied some changes, but ultimately, I ended up copying the original code, since there was at least one bug that was hard for me to track down. The logic is also unnecessarily complex, so simple changes dont' fit well.
